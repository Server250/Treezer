# Treezer
---------------------------------------------------------------
A parser for HTML files that converts to useful python objects.

I know technically the data structure uses heaps but I like the Weezer pun so it stays. =W=

If this works, it is all dedicated to the guy on stackoverflow who said it was a stupid idea. If it doesn't work, this repo will be private so he never knows.
